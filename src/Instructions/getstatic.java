/**
 *
 * @author Zachy getstatic indexbyte1 indexbyte2 The unsigned indexbyte1 and
 * indexbyte2 are used to construct an index into the run-time constant pool of
 * the current class (ยง2.6), where the value of the index is (indexbyte1 << 8) |
 * indexbyte2. The run-time constant pool item at that index must be a symbolic
 * reference to a field (ยง5.1), which gives the name and descriptor of the field
 * as well as a symbolic reference to the class or interface in which the field
 * is to be found. The referenced field is resolved (ยง5.4.3.2).
 *
 * On successful resolution of the field, the class or interface that declared
 * the resolved field is initialized (ยง5.5) if that class or interface has not
 * already been initialized.
 *
 * The value of the class or interface field is fetched and pushed onto the
 * operand stack.
